For example, if you have a 2D list (a list of lists), you use nested loops to access each element.</p> </li> <li> <p>Complex Algorithms - Some algorithms inherently require nested loops. Examples include sorting algorithms like bubble sort, insertion sort, or selection sort, which involve comparing each element with others.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cross-Product Operations - When you need to compute the Cartesian product of two sets or lists, nested loops allow you to generate all possible pairs of elements.</p> </li> <li> <p>Combinations and Permutations - Generating combinations or permutations of a set of elements typically involves nested loops.</p> </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Example 6.5.1 - Iterating through a 2D list</p> <p>Here's a simple example of nested iterations to print each element of a 2D list.</p> <pre><code>matrix = [\n    [1, 2, 3],\n    [4, 5, 6],\n    [7, 8, 9]\n]\n\nfor row in matrix:\n    for element in row:\n        print(element, end=' ')\n    print()  # Print a new line after each row\n</code></pre> <p>Example 6.5.1 - Output</p>  <pre>\n1 2 3 \n4 5 6 \n7 8 9\n</pre>  <p> </p> <p>Example 6.5.2 -  Generating Cartesian Product</p> <p>Here's an example of generating all pairs from two lists using nested loops.</p> <pre><code>list1 = [1, 2, 3]\nlist2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n\nfor item1 in list1:\n    for item2 in list2:\n        print(f\"({item1}, {item2})\")\n</code></pre> <p>Example 6.5.2 - Output</p>  <pre>\n(1, a)\n(1, b)\n(1, c)\n(2, a)\n(2, b)\n(2, c)\n(3, a)\n(3, b)\n(3, c)\n</pre>  <p> </p> <p>Example 6.5.3 - Creating a Multiplication Table Here's another example to generate a multiplication table using nested loops.</p> <pre><code>for i in range(1, 6):\n    for j in range(1, 6):\n        print(f\"{i * j:2}\", end=' ')\n    print()  # Print a new line after each row\n</code></pre> <p> </p> <p>Example 6.5.3 - Output</p>  <pre>\n 1  2  3  4  5 \n 2  4  6  8 10 \n 3  6  9 12 15 \n 4  8 12 16 20 \n 5 10 15 20 25\n</pre>  <p> </p> <p>Example 6.5.3 - Explanation</p> <ol> <li> <p>Outer Loop (<code>for i in range(1, 6):</code>)</p> <ul> <li>This loop iterates through the numbers 1 to 5.

The outer loop runs 5 times, once for each number in this range.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Inner Loop (<code>for j in range(1, 6):</code>)</p> <ul> <li>Inside the outer loop, there's another loop that iterates through the numbers 1 to 5. The variable <code>j</code> represents the current column in the multiplication table.</li> <li><code>range(1, 6)</code> generates the sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The inner loop also runs 5 times for each number in this range.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Multiplication and Printing (<code>print(f\"{i * j:2}\", end=' ')</code>)</p> <ul> <li>Inside the inner loop, <code>i * j</code> calculates the product of the current row number (<code>i</code>) and the current column number (<code>j</code>).</li> <li>The <code>print</code> function is used to display this product. The format string <code>f\"{i * j:2}\"</code> ensures that the output is at least 2 characters wide, which helps to align the numbers neatly in columns.</li> <li><code>end=' '</code> specifies that the output should end with a space instead of a newline, so the numbers are printed on the same line.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>New Line (<code>print()</code>)</p> <ul> <li>After the inner loop completes (i.e., after all columns for the current row are printed), <code>print()</code> is called without any arguments to print a newline character.

To return multiple values - Python allows functions to return multiple values as a tuple. This can be handy for functions that need to return more than one piece of information. [tuples will be tackled in Section 8]</p> <p>Example 7.3.8 - To return multiple values <pre><code>def get_min_max(numbers):\n    return min(numbers), max(numbers)\n\nmin_val, max_val = get_min_max([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\nprint(min_val, max_val)\n</code></pre></p> <p>Example 7.3.8 - Output</p>  <pre>\n1 5\n</pre>  <p> </p>  <p> </p>","text":""},{"location":"07.Functions-and-modules/7.3-Create-user-defined-functions/#73c-when-return-is-not-used","title":"7.3c  When return is not used <p>Omit <code>return</code> (or use it without a value) when the function's primary purpose is to perform an action or cause a side effect, and no value needs to be passed back to the caller.</p> <p>1. Performing an action without needing a result - If the function's purpose is to perform an action (like printing a message, modifying a global variable, or updating an object) and you do not need to <code>return</code> any result, you can omit the return statement.
